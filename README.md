# Custom Changes to the original project
- Removing a card pauses the music. Returning the same card on the reader resumes the music.
- Long press was removed for back and forward button. Instead volume can be controlled via a potentiometer attached to PIN A3
- A 4-Digit 7 Segment LED Display (TM1637) was attached to Pins D5 and D6 in order to display the current track number
- Album mode pressing next track when the last track is playing, starts the first track. Pressing previous track when the first track is playing, plays the last track in the folder
