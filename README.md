Forked from https://www.voss.earth/tonuino/

# Custom Changes to the original project
- Removing a card pauses the music. Returning the same card on the reader resumes the music.
- Long press was removed for back and forward button. Instead volume can be controlled via a potentiometer attached to PIN A3
